# JSearch API Integration Setup

## ‚úÖ Completed Changes

I've successfully integrated the JSearch API to work alongside Adzuna, which will significantly increase the number of job listings on your site.

### What Was Changed:

1. **Modified `backend/netlify/functions/search.js`**:
   - Added JSearch API integration
   - Both APIs now run in parallel using `Promise.allSettled` for better performance
   - Results are merged and deduplicated based on job title + company
   - Jobs are sorted by posting date (most recent first)
   - Each job now shows its source (Adzuna or JSearch)

### How It Works:

- When a user searches, the function calls both Adzuna and JSearch APIs simultaneously
- Results from both APIs are processed and normalized to the same format
- Duplicate jobs are removed (same title + company from different sources)
- If one API fails, the other continues working
- The response now includes source information so you can track which API is working

## üîß Next Steps - CRITICAL SETUP REQUIRED

### Add JSearch API Key to Netlify (MUST DO THIS NOW):

1. Go to your Netlify dashboard: https://app.netlify.com
2. Select your **futurelinked-za** site
3. Go to **Site configuration** ‚Üí **Environment variables**
4. Click **Add a variable** ‚Üí **Add a single variable**
5. Add:
   - **Key**: `JSEARCH_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: `9925807393msh164bd73c56850cep18f7c9jsn0c10b4650be6`
6. Click **Save**

### Deploy Changes:

After adding the environment variable, push your changes to GitHub:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\maand\OneDrive\Desktop\FutureLinkedZA"
git add .
git commit -m "Integrate JSearch API for more job listings"
git push origin main
```

Netlify will automatically deploy the changes.

## üéØ Benefits:

- **More Job Listings**: Combined results from both Adzuna and JSearch
- **Better Coverage**: JSearch focuses on tech and professional jobs
- **Reliability**: If one API fails, the other still works
- **Deduplication**: Users won't see the same job twice
- **Performance**: Parallel API calls mean faster responses

## üìä Testing:

After deployment, search for jobs and you should see:
- More results than before
- Job cards showing "Source: Adzuna" or "Source: JSearch"
- No duplicate listings
- Faster load times (parallel API calls)

## üîç Troubleshooting:

If you see fewer results after deployment:
1. Check Netlify deploy logs for errors
2. Verify the environment variable was added correctly
3. Check browser console for any errors
4. The API might need a few minutes to start working

If jobs only show from one source:
- Check the browser console or Netlify function logs
- One API might be rate-limited or temporarily down
- The system is designed to work even if one API fails
